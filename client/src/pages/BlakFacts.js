                        <p>
                            Words and grammar matter
                            as language holds a key part in shaping cultures and socities.

                            A curious part of grammar when it comes to Kimberly kriol
                            is our use of the they/them pronouns.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is very common to hear someone using those pronouns for a person 
                            who's gender is known. 
                            "Where them go?" "who they with".
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is simple and flows off of the tongue. And most importantly,
                            expresses that first and formost everyone is a person, their gender second.

                            used the long straight grasses of the spinfex plants as a economical

                                The Bunuba poeple have the belief that because women have the children, 
                                the children must follow the mothers way.
                                We are Matriarchal.

                                My grandparents on my father's side are from two different
                                language groups, Bunuba and Jija/Kija.
                                Yet I claim Bunuba because we go women's way.

                                Many language groups are patriarchal, but don't compare that 
                                to the white patriarchy we live in, they respected women.
