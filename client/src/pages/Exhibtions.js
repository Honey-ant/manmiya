                    My debut exhibition was in January 2022 in Naarm (Melbourne Australia).
                    This was were a fantastic collection of artists called the 'Kiss my Art Collective'.

                    My second and current exhibition is an online fundraising event that I am so lucky and gratful to be apart of.
                    The fundraiser is for the 'Art of Healing' foundation, that is based in Canada.
                    This foundation was founded by my therapist Atira Tan. 
                    Someone I am in awe of for so many reasons.

                                    It was held in Coburg at the schoolhouse studios.
