                A self taught artist emerging. They are a visual artist 
                primarily working with acrylic paints and oils. 
                Their art is an expression of their inner most thoughts, 
                healing and emotional processing. 
                Many of their works come to life quickly as the urge takes hold
                to create, to express.
                Their style is a mixture of their own Cultural Idenity as a Bunuba Woman,
                intertwined with all the complexities of living in the colony.
